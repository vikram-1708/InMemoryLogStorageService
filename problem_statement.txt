Problem Statement:-

Assignment: In-Memory Log Storage
Build an application that stores logs in memory (no external database). Continuous logs are coming from multiple microservices and have the following fields:

timestamp (time at which the log was generated)
serviceName (name of the microservice)
hostId (identifier of the host where the service is running)
logMessage (the log text)

Requirements:-
1. The application should support concurrent log ingestion and queries.
2. Must support the following queries:
   a. Logs of a given serviceName between time t1 and t2.
   b. Logs of a given serviceName from a given hostId between time t1 and t2.
   c. Logs of a given hostId between time t1 and t2.
3. Code should be runnable and follow clean code guidelines (readability, structure, maintainability).
